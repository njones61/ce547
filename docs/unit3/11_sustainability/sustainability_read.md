# Pre-Class - Groundwater Sustainability Analysis

In this pre-class, we will introduce groundwater as a vital resource, supplying roughly 40% of public water, and explain why learning to manage it matters for drinking water security, healthy ecosystems, and community resilience. We will define groundwater sustainability as the long-term use of aquifers without causing unacceptable environmental, economic, or social harm, and explain how pumping, recharge, and stored water interact over years to centuries. We will highlight common pitfalls such as the "water-budget myth" and the consequences of overpumping.
