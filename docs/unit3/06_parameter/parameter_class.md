# Automated Parameter Estimation - Big Valley

The model we will be calibrating in this exercise is the same model featured in the previous in-class task. The model includes observed flow data for the stream and observed heads at a set of scattered observation wells. The conceptual model for the site consists of a set of recharge and hydraulic conductivity zones. These zones will be marked as parameters and we will use PEST to automatically find a set of recharge and hydraulic conductivity values that minimize the calibration error. We will parameterize the model using polygonal zones.
