# MODFLOW Case Study - Transient Simulation

For this exercise we will build a transient version of the same model used in the [<u>Model Calibration</u>](https://byu-ce547.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit3/05_calibration/calibration_class/) exercise. We will use the computed heads from the steady state calibrated flow model as the starting heads for our transient simulation. Transient recharge and pumping conditions will be modeled. The recharge rates will be manually entered but the pumping rates will be imported from a text file. We will also import a set of transient-field-observed heads from observation wells.

Do the following:

1) Go to the Aquaveo tutorial website:

>[<u>http://www.aquaveo.com/software/gms-learning-tutorials</u>](https://byu-ce547.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit3/03_study_pt3/learning-tutorials.htm)

2) Download and unzip the zip archive associated with the **Managing Transient Data** tutorial exercise. This will be used as the starting point for our exercise.

3) Download and open the PDF file associated with the **Managing Transient Data** tutorial exercise.

4) Download the following file and open it in Excel. You can cut-and-paste some of the values to save time in the tutorial.

5) Follow the instructions to complete the tutorial.

## Solution

The zip archive associated with the tutorial includes a sample solution to the exercise.
