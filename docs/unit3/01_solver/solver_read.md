# Pre-Class - MODFLOW Solvers

In this pre-class, we learn how different MODFLOW solvers work to find solutions for groundwater flow, with most using iterative methods like PCG, SIP, and NWT, each suited to different modeling challenges. We also explore key solver settings, troubleshooting tips, and common causes of non-convergence.
