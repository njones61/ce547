# MODFLOW Conceptual Model Approach, Part 3 - East Texas

For this exercise we will complete part 3 of the conceptual model approach tutorial. We will convert our 1-layer model to a 2-layer model. We will also interpolated our top and bottom elevations from a raster and a scatter point set. Finally, we will experiment with some options for assigning the wells to specific layers.

To build the model, do the following:

1) Go to the Aquaveo tutorial website:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<u>http://www.aquaveo.com/software/gms-learning-tutorials</u>](https://byu-ce547.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit3/03_study_pt3/learning-tutorials.htm)

2) Download and unzip the zip archive associated with the **Conceptual Model Approach 3** tutorial exercise.

3) Download and open the PDF file associated with the **Conceptual Model Approach 3** tutorial exercise.

4) Follow the instructions to complete the tutorial.

# MODFLOW Conceptual Model Approach, Part 4 - East Texas

For this exercise we will complete part 4 of the conceptual model approach tutorial. We will define vertical anisotropy for the K values in layers 1 & 2, we will add a new recharge polygon for the landfill by importing a shapefile, we will assign drain elevations using a raster, and we will use the MNW2 package for a more sophisticated approach to partitioning the well flow between multiple layers.
