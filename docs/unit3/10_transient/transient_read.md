# Pre-Class - Transient MODFLOW Simulations

In this pre-class, we learn how the governing equations for groundwater flow are modified for transient conditions, adding a storage term to account for changes in aquifer water volume over time. We discuss how these equations apply in both areal flow contexts and in different aquifer types, using storage coefficients like specific storage and specific yield to represent how much water is released or taken in. Finally, we cover how transient simulations in MODFLOW are set up, including initial conditions, stress periods, and time steps, so we can model changing conditions accurately.
