# Pre-Class - Darcy's Law

In this pre-class, we will introduce Darcy's Law, which serves as the foundation for groundwater modeling and understanding flow through porous media. Developed by French civil engineer Henry Darcy through experiments in the 1800s, this law provides a simple equation to calculate the volumetric flow rate through soil. It states that flow is directly proportional to hydraulic conductivity, cross-sectional area, and head difference, while being inversely proportional to the length of the flow path.
