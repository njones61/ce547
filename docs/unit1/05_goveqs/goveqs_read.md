# Pre-Class - Governing Equations

In this pre-class, we explore how the governing differential equations for groundwater flow are derived from mass conservation and Darcyâ€™s Law, beginning with a general 3D case and simplifying to 2D forms for confined and unconfined aquifers. We also examine how assumptions like steady-state flow, isotropy, and Dupuit's simplifications influence the form of the equations, which are ultimately solved using analytical, graphical, or numerical methods to predict groundwater behavior.
