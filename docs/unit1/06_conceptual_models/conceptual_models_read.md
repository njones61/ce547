# Pre-Class - Conceptual Models

In this pre-class, we learn how a conceptual model gives a clear, simplified picture of an aquifer system before building a numerical model. We identify key features like hydrogeologic units, boundary conditions, and sources or sinks, while also considering how model complexity, dimensionality, and flow type (steady-state vs. transient) depend on project goals, available data, and the flow budget.
