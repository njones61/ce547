# Pre-Class - Groundwater Modeling Concepts

In this pre-class, we will introduce the concept of groundwater modeling and the basic concepts of groundwater flow. We will review the main steps in the process of groundwater modeling and the main types of models used in groundwater flow simulations. We will also discuss the main assumptions and limitations of groundwater models.
