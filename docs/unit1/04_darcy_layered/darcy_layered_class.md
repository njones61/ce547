# Exercise - Darcy Flow Through Layered Systems

# Part 1 - Layered Soils

Consider the following layered soils:

![layers_eqs.png](images/layers_eqs.png)

Calculate the flow parallel and perpendicular to the layering. Use the following parameters: Driving head = 5 ft. Width (dx) = 100 ft. Height (dy) = 20 ft.
