# Pre-Class - 2D Geostatistics

In this pre-class, we explore additional tools in GMS that use 2D geostatistics and interpolation methods to define MODFLOW layer elevations from scatter point data. These tools, including Kriging, IDW, and others, build on previous steps to create more accurate representations of complex subsurface geology.
