# Homework - Introduction to MODFLOW

Note: You may work in pairs on this assignment.

Solve the following problems. 

1\. Complete tutorial
>a\. Go to the Tutorials section of the Aquaveo GMS Learning Center:
>>http://www.aquaveo.com/software/gms-lear ning-tutorials <br>

>b\. In the **General section**, click on the PDF link associated with **Grid Approach** tutorial. Note: You don't need to download the associated zip file in this case. <br>
c\. Launch GMS and follow the steps in the tutorial to build a three-layer MODFLOW model in GMS. <br>

2. Model Analysis
>Using the things you have learned from the tutorial exercise, perform the following model analysis. <br>
a. Using the flow budget tool, determine how much water is being lost through the drains. <br>
b. Convert the number from the previous step to AFA (acre-ft per year).<br>
c. Suppose that it is observed in the field that the actual discharge through the drains is approximately 100,000 m^3/day. Modify the conductance of the drain cells and rerun the model repeatedly until the discharge to the drains is equal to this value (+/- 2000 m^3/d). What is the resulting conductance? <br>
d. Based on the conductance you found, would you say that the model is sensitive or insensitive to the drain conductance? <br>
e. Did your changes cause the water level in the region surrounding the drains to go up or down? Does that make sense? Explain why it went up or down. <br>







## Submission

Save your work in a file named `_hw.xlsx` and upload it on Learning Suite after we grade it together in class.

## Grading Rubric

Self-grade your assignment using the following rubric. Enter your points in the "Submission notes" section for the assignment on Learning Suite when you upload your file. You can use fractional points if you like (e.g. 2.5).
