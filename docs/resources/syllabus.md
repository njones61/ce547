# Syllabus

## Course Objectives

The objective of this course is to give you a thorough introduction to groundwater flow modeling and modeling principles in general. This course is application oriented. We cover the fundamental equations and the modeling theory but the emphasis is on teaching you how to solve real world problems. At the end of the semester, you should feel confident in your ability to develop and calibrate a complex 3D groundwater model.

Most of the homework assignments for this course are solved with a computer. We will learn to use several groundwater models including MODFLOW and MODPATH. We will also be using the [Groundwater Modeling System (GMS)](https://aquaveo.com//software/gms/introduction). GMS is a graphical pre- and post-processor for the groundwater models we will be using. Using GMS will allow you to learn the fundamental issues related to groundwater modeling without forcing you to spend hours manually organizing input data in a text editor. GMS is available to you on campus in the CAEDM lab the CAEDM labs. If you wish to use GMS on your home computer, you may download a PC version of GMS from the [Aquaveo Website](http://www.aquaveo.com/). After you have downloaded and installed GMS, launch GMS and select the Register command in the File menu. E-mail the security string to me and I will give you a temporary password that will enable GMS.

## Course Outcomes

## Lecture Format

The course will be taught in a "flipped" format. For each class period, you are expected to carefully study the "pre-class" content which will consist of videos and/or reading. A link to the pre-class content for each lecture will be provided on the Learning Suite schedule. You should complete the pre-class content before the associated class period. The class period will be used for discussing the pre-class content and working through exercises together. 

## Quizzes

I have recorded a series of lectures introducing modeling theory, underlying equations, details about MODFLOW, etc. The videos for these lectures are linked on the class schedule (see the "link" text next to lecture topics on the left). The videos are hosted on YouTube. You can watch them at your convenience. Some days we will doing exercises and not introducing any new material, so there won't be any lectures listed on these days. But for each day there is a video, there will also be a pre-class quiz. The first question will be "Did you watch the video?" There will also be a few simple questions that you can answer pretty easily if you have watched the video. Finally the last question will be a free response asking if any of the video topics are not clear. 

You will be able to retake the quiz as many times as you like before the deadline, which is 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the class period on the day the quiz is due. The quizzes are designed to help you review the material and ensure you are prepared for the in-class exercises.

You will be allowed to drop 3 quiz scores. There will be no makeup quizzes.

When we meet in class, we will review parts of the video that needs more explanation, answer questions, and have a short discussion on the topic. Then we will work on in-class exercises related to the topic. As a result, some classes will be short and some will be longer, depending on the exercises. The goal is to allow you to review the main content at your convenience, reinforce where needed, and learn by doing hands-on work.

## Exams

There will be two midterm exams and a final exam. The final exam will be comprehensive. All exams will be given online using Learning Suite and Proctorio.  Each exam will have a time limit (3 hrs for the midterms, 4 hrs for the final). The penalty for going over the time limit is two points per minute. There will be no make-up exams. If you are unable to take an exam at the scheduled time because of extreme circumstances beyond your control, visit with me and we will arrange something.

## Homework

The homework is essential to reinforce the topics covered in class. The homework will also prepare you for the exams. Since we do not have a TA for the class, we will grade the homework together at the beginning of class in the class period immediately following when an assignment is due. You don't need to upload your completed assignment until after we have graded it, so technically it is not due until that time. However, you should have the assignment completed before class so we can grade it together. I will show you the solution to the homework and you will grade your own work using the 
3-pt rubric provided at the end of each assignment. You will then upload your completed assignment to Learning Suite 
and enter your grade in the "Submission notes" section for the assignment on Learning Suite. 

Since we go over the solutions together in class and self-grade the homework, late homework will not be accepted. If you have a legitimate reason for not having the homework completed before we grade it in class, you should contact 
me to get permission for a late submission.

## Term Project
There will be a term project that will involve building a complete groundwater model of a real-world site. More details about the project are provided on the [Term Project Overview page.](https://byu-ce547.readthedocs.io/en/latest/termproject/tpoverview/tp_overview/)

## Academic Honesty

If I discover that you have cheated on one of my exams, I will give you a failing grade for the course and refer you to the BYU Honor Code Office.
I encourage you to work together on the homework as long as everyone is contributing and learning. You may not simply copy one another's work. You may not copy old homework. You must understand the lectures and the homework in order to perform well on the exams

## Grades

Grades will be assigned based on the following formula. See Learning Suite for a complete list of scores and grades.

## Microsoft Teams

There will be a **Microsoft Teams** group for this class. You will be invited to join the group by the instructor. The group will be used for announcements, discussions, and questions. You are encouraged to ask questions and participate in discussions. We will also use the group for virtual office hours. I can jump on video chat to help you with your homework or answer questions.

You can access Teams through the web interface or by downloading the app to your computer or phone. You should get in the habit of checking the group regularly for announcements and discussions. You can also set up notifications to be alerted when there is new activity in the group.

## Textbooks

There are no required textbooks for this course. However, the following books are recommended and will be useful references throughout the course:

**Optional**: [Anderson, Woessner, and Hunt, Applied Groundwater Modeling: Simulation of Flow and Advective Transport](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Groundwater-Modeling-Simulation-Advective/dp/0123847052)

Widely used textbook that covers the fundamental concepts of groundwater modeling. It is a good reference for the topics we will cover in this course. It is not required, but I recommend it if you want a deeper understanding of the subject.

**Optional**: [Harr, A Civil Action](https://www.amazon.com/Civil-Action-Jonathan-Harr/dp/067976152X)

This is a best-selling non-fiction novel that happens to be a legal thriller about a major court case involving a series of deaths which may have been linked to groundwater contamination. It was awarded the title of Best Non-Fiction Novel of 1995. I think you will enjoy it and it will provide us with some very interesting topics of discussion. Also, our term project will involve building a model of the groundwater flow system described in the book. The book has been made into a movie starring John Travolta. But, of course, the book is always better than the movie.

**Optional**: [McDonald and Harbaugh, A Modular Three-Dimensional Finite-Difference Groundwater Model, U.S.G.S.](https://ce547.groups.et.byu.net/syllabus/docs/modflow.pdf)

This is the reference manual for MODFLOW, a model we will discuss in great detail. The manual is public domain (not copyrighted). Click on the link above to get an electronic copy. This is the entire manual minus most of the FORTRAN source code.
