## Course Objectives

As the name implies, we will cover two main topics: seepage and slope stability. The two topics are related since seepage and slope stability analyses are often done in tandem.

Seepage analysis can take many forms, but the type of analysis we will be doing in this class is the analysis of seepage through vertical profiles, i.e., vertical cross-sections through dams, levees, embankments, etc. We will look at analytical solutions, graphical solutions (flow nets), and numerical solutions (both finite difference and finite element analysis). We will also look at the uses wells for construction dewatering.

Slope stability analysis is the process of analyzing slopes and embankments to determine the factor of safety against slope failure. It is routinely performed on dams, levees, excavations (cuts for highways, etc.), mine tailings, and embankments. Most stability analyses are performed with the aid of a specialized computer program, but we will look at simple cases that can be solved with charts, equations, or spreadsheets.

## Course Outcomes

After successfully completing this course, you should:

1. Be able to apply Darcy's law to solve basic problems related to flow through porous media.
2. Understand the governing equations for 2D and 3D groundwater flow, including what simplifying assumptions are used 
   in the derivation of the equations.
3. Be able to create and interpret graphical solutions (flow nets) to the governing equations.
4. Be able to apply analytical solutions to the governing equations, including well equations.
5. Be able to apply analytical solutions to construction dewatering problems.
6. Understand the finite difference solution and be able to create finite difference solutions in Excel.
7. Understand how the finite element method works and how the finite element equations are formulated.
8. Be able to apply finite element software to solve complex seepage analysis problems.
9. Understand the basic concepts of the limit equilibrium method of slope stability.
10. Be able to apply slope stability charts for simple problems.
11. Be able to apply slope stablity software (such as UTEXAS) for common slope stablility problems.
12. Be able to solve special cases of slope stability including, reinforced slopes, rapid drawdown, and seismic 
    conditions.

## Lecture Format

The course will be taught in a "flipped" format. For each class period, you are expected to carefully study the "pre-class" content which will consist of videos and/or reading. A link to the pre-class content for each lecture will be provided on the Learning Suite schedule. You should complete the pre-class content before the associated calss period. The class period will be used for discussing the pre-class content and working through exercises together. 

## Quizzes

There will be pre-class quiz associated with each lecture based on the pre-class content. Each quiz is worth 7 points. The first question which is worth 2 pts, is "Did you complete the pre-class content?". Then there will be 4 questions based on that content, and finally there will be an open response question where you are asked if there was anything from the pre-class content that was not clear that you would like to review in class. The quizzes will be on Learning Suite and will be due 15 minutes prior to class.

## Exams

Exams will be given on-line. You will have a 2-3 days to take the exam. The exam will be timed and you will have 3 hours to complete it. The exam will be closed book, closed notes, and closed internet. You may not discuss the exam with anyone else until the exam period is over. You may not use any other person to help you with the exam. You may not use any other person's work as your own.

Since we are covering two distinct topics, there will be two exams. The first exam will cover the seepage portion of the class and the second exam will cover the slope stability portion.

## Homework

The homework is essential to reinforce the topics covered in class. The homework will also prepare you for the exams. Since we do not have a TA for the class, we will grade the homework together at the beginning of class in the class 
period immediately following when an assignment is due. You don't need to upload your completed assignment until after we have graded it, so technically it is not due until that time. However, you should have the assignment completed before class so we can grade it together. I will show you the solution to the homework and you will grade your own work using the 
3-pt rubric provided at the end of each assignment. You will then upload your completed assignment to Learning Suite 
and enter your grade in the "Submission notes" section for the assignment on Learning Suite. 

Since we go over the solutions together in class and self-grade the homework, late homework will not be accepted. If 
you have a legitimate reason for not having the homework completed before we grade it in class, you should contact 
me to get permission for a late submission.

## Academic Honesty

If I discover that you have cheated on one of my exams, I will give you a failing grade for the course and refer you to the BYU Honor Code Office.
I encourage you to work together on the homework as long as everyone is contributing and learning. You may not simply copy one another's work. You may not copy old homework. You must understand the lectures and the homework in order to perform well on the exams

## Grades

Grades will be assigned based on the following formula. See Learning Suite for a complete list of scores and grades.

| Item | Percentage |
|------|------------|
| Homework | 25% |
| Case Study | 7% |
| Exam #1 | 30% |
| Exam #2 | 30% |
| Quizzes | 8% |
| Total | 100% |

## Microsoft Teams

There will be a **Micorsoft Teams** group for this class. You will be invited to join the group by the instructor. The group will be used for announcements, discussions, and questions. You are encouraged to ask questions and participate in discussions. We will also use the group for virtual office hours. I can jump on video chat to help you with your homework or answer questions.

You can access Teams through the web interface or by downloading the app to your computer or phone. You should get in the habit of checking the group regularly for announcements and discussions. You can also set up notifications to be alerted when there is new activity in the group.

## Textbooks

**Required**: _Soil Strength and Slope Stability, 2nd Edition_, Duncan, Wright, and Brandon

We will use text primarily during the second part of the semester. You can access this textbook for free through the BYU library as described in the [Textbook](./textbook.md) section.

**Optional**: _Construction Dewatering and Groundwater Control_, Powers, Et al.

Good reference on dewatering issues

**Optional**: _Seepage, Drainage, and Flow Nets_, Cedergren.

Good, but dated. Last edition published in 1997.
